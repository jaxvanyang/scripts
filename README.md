# Tiny Scripts

Some tiny scripts that do simple works. I don't want to write them twice, so I put them here and share with you.

Scripts here may be used only once. For more general scripts, you could check out another repo of mine: [jaxvanyang/shell-tools: My shell tools that make CLI experience easier.](https://github.com/jaxvanyang/shell-tools).
